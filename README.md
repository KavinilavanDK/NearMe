It is a small farm might cultivate crops like rice, millets, or sugarcane, reflecting the region's diverse agriculture.
 Farmers often use traditional methods and may face challenges like water scarcity. Livestock such as cows or goats could be part
  of the farm, contributing to the rural economy. The farm life there is closely tied to the seasons, with festivals and rituals
   often linked to agriculturalÂ cycles.
